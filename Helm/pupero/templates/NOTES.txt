Thank you for installing Pupero!

This release includes:
- Pupero core services (DB, RabbitMQ, Login, Offers, Transactions, API Manager, Admin, Flask UI, Sweeper)
- Monero services (monerod testnet, wallet-rpc, walletmanager)
- Matrix services (Postgres, Synapse, Element)
- An Ingress for host pupero.replay.dog
- A minimal ingress-nginx controller using NodePorts 30080 (HTTP) and 30443 (HTTPS)

Next steps
1) Point your DNS A record for pupero.replay.dog to a node in your cluster that can accept traffic on NodePort 30080.
2) Open firewall for:
   - TCP 30080 (HTTP) and optionally 30443 (HTTPS) to your chosen node
3) Visit: http://pupero.replay.dog/

If you already have an Ingress controller
- You may safely ignore the controller installed by this chart or remove templates/ingress-nginx.yaml and re-install.

Monero wallet files (optional but recommended)
- The monero-wallet-rpc container expects a secret named monero-wallet-files with keys:
  Pupero-Wallet, Pupero-Wallet.keys, Pupero-Wallet.address.txt
- Replace the placeholders in templates/secrets.yaml with base64 content of your wallet files, or apply your own Secret after install and restart pupero-wallet-rpc.
